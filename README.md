# Robot-Face-Image-Processing-Deep-Learning-and-Emotional-Detection-Project
A real-time facial emotion recognition system using deep learning and image processing. Built with a modified VGG16 CNN model trained on the FER-2013 dataset, this project uses PyTorch and OpenCV to classify emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral) from live webcam input.
